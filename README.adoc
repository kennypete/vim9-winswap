This Vim9 script plugin enables you to swap or clone Vim windows easily.
As a Vim9 script plugin, it works with Vim exclusively, and requires Vim
version 9 (though from 8.2.4883 should work too).

Vim&#x2019;s native window `CTRL-W` commands, like `CTRL-W r`, `CTRL-W x`,
and `CTRL-W T`, work well in many scenarios.
However, there are limitations.  For example, `CTRL-W r`, &#x201C;only works
within the row or column of windows that the current window is in&#x201D;.
Also, there is no ability to move windows to another _existing_ tab.

vim9-winswap lets you:

1. Swap a chosen window with _any_ other, including a window in another
existing tab, or
2. Put (clone) a chosen window into _any_ other window, leaving the
&#x201C;yanked&#x201D; window as-is, or
3. Use `:Winswap` to swap two chosen windows (within the same tab).

In all instances:

* Window-local options are carried across to the moved or cloned window.
That is, options like `list`, `colorcolumn`, and `spell`, which
are exclusively window-local.
* The state of the marked/&#x201C;yanked&#x201D; window is cleared
following a swap or put.

NOTE: The plugin https://github.com/wesQ3/vim-windowswap[vim-windowswap]
is a legacy vimscript plugin, which provides some similar functionality for
swapping windows.  Its &#x201C;swap&#x201D; key mapping, `<Leader>ww`, has
been used in this plugin&#x2019;s _optional_ mappings.  There are
improvements in vim9-winswap, too; e.g., ensuring the window-local
settings are carried across.

[#how-to-swap-windows]
== How to swap windows

As shown in Demo 1 and Demo 4:

1. Navigate to the first window you want to swap.
2. `<Leader>ww` to mark the first window and remember its settings.
3. Navigate to the second window you want to swap with the first.
4. `<Leader>ww` to remember the second window's settings and swap the windows.

NOTE: `<Leader>ww` is not fixed - you can choose whatever you want - but it is
enabled if you used `g:winswap_opt_maps = true` in your (Vim9) .vimrc/_vimrc.

[#how-to-put-clone-a-window]
== How to put (clone) a window

As shown in Demo 2:

1. Navigate to the window you want to put.
2. `<Leader>ww` to mark the window and remember its settings.
3. Navigate to the window you want to substitute.
4. `<Leader>wp` to substitute the window with the cloned window from point 1.

NOTE: `<Leader>wp` is not fixed - you can choose whatever you want - but it is
enabled if you used `g:winswap_opt_maps = true` in your (Vim9) .vimrc/_vimrc.

== How to swap windows by window number

As shown in Demo 3, if you know the window numbers of the two windows
you want to swap, you can use the `:Winswap` command:

[source,vim]
----
:Winswap 4 2
----

This swaps windows 4 and 2.  The command accepts any two valid
window numbers (though only within the same tab).

NOTE: For convenience, there is command abbreviation `Ws`, which expands
to `Winswap`.

== Mappings

=== Using `g:winswap_opt_maps`

If you are satisfied with using `<Leader>ww` and `<Leader>wp`, as explained
in <<how-to-swap-windows,How to swap windows>>
and <<how-to-put-clone-a-window,How to put (clone) a window>>, all you need
to do is include the following in your .vimrc/_vimrc:

[source,vim]
----
g:winswap_opt_maps = true
----

=== `<Plug>` mappings and customising your mappings

There are only two inherent mappings, both of which only work in Normal mode.
They are `<Plug>` mappings, so they should not conflict with anything:

* `<Plug>(Winswap_ww)`
+
If there is no currently marked window, this marks it as the window that will
either be swapped or put/cloned.  If there already is a currently marked
window, it swaps the two windows.

* `<Plug>(Winswap_wp)`
+
Provided there is a currently marked window, this will put it (clone it to)
where the current window is.

If you want to map either or both of the `<Plug>` mappings to keys of your
own choosing, it is easy.  For example:

[source,vim]
----
nnoremap <C-W>2 <Plug>(Winswap_ww)
nnoremap <C-W>1 <Plug>(Winswap_wp)
----

Now `<C-W>2` will do the same as what `<Leader>ww` would do and `<C-W>1` will
do the same as what `<Leader>wp` would do.

CAUTION: If you use sessions, mappings including `<ScriptCmd>`, which is what
vim9-winswap uses, will be broken when a session is restored.  This is a 
https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/16688[known issue], which, at the time of
writing may be fixed in future.  However, to avoid the issue, an autocmd and
https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/16738#issuecomment-3092576293[function]
may be added to your .vimrc/_vimrc.

== Installation

=== Using Vim&#x2019;s package management

From your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/kennypete/vim9-winswap ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim9-winswap
----

Adjust this as necessary for Windows and/or for `plugins`, which can be whatever
you want.  Also, if you want manual control of plugin loading, use `opt` instead
of `start`, then include `packadd vim9-winswap` in your .vimrc/_vimrc.

=== vim-plug

Add to your .vimrc/_vimrc, with your other
plugins, `Plug 'kennypete/vim9-winswap'`.
